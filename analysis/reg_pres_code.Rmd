# Reading In the Raw Data

# Data Cleaning & Transformations

## Logging earnings

Because the response data (earnings) is skewed, we log the data to make it more normal.

```{r}
income_df %>% 
  mutate(earningslog = log(total.person.earnings)) %>%
  filter(earningslog != "-Inf") %>% #removing undefined results
  filter(earningslog != "Inf") %>% #removing undefined results
  filter(!is.nan(earningslog)) -> income_df_logged #removing anything else 

ggplot(data = income_df_logged, mapping = aes(x = earningslog))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) #data looks more normal / unimodal 

```

## Filtering down to the IQR

Our project is aimed at understanding the average American's income. As a result, we filtered our dataset down to the middle 50% of individuals.

```{r}
summary(income_df_logged$total.person.earnings)

#lower threshold 32000
#upper threshold 83000

income_df_logged %>% 
  filter(total.person.earnings > 32000) %>%
  filter(total.person.earnings < 83000) -> income_IQR
head(income_IQR)

income_IQR$race  <- as_factor(income_IQR$race)
income_IQR$education  <- as_factor(income_IQR$education)
income_IQR$industry  <- as_factor(income_IQR$industry)
income_IQR$sex <- as_factor(income_IQR$sex)

## Model 1: Log Earnings = 𝛃0 + 𝛃1\*Race

Model Coefficients:

```{r}

```

Significant Model Coefficients (at alpha = .05):

```{r}
broom::tidy(summary(model1)) %>% filter(p.value < .05)
```

ANOVA Table

```{r}

```

```{r}

#generally normal notwithstanding deviations at tail ends
#residuals -- NCV
```

## Model 2: Log Earnings = 𝛃0 + 𝛃1\*Race + 𝛃2\*Industry

Model Coefficients:

```{r}
lm(earningslog ~ race + industry, data = income_IQR) -> model2
broom::tidy(model2$coefficients) 
```

Significant Model Coefficients (at alpha = .05):

```{r}
broom::tidy(summary(model2)) %>% filter(p.value < .05)
```

ANOVA Table

```{r}
broom::tidy(anova(model2))
```

```{r}
plot(model2)
#definitely should remove case on far right and far left
#residuals appear to be slightly downward sloping but are generally within -.6 and .6. Variance is relatively constant. 
#Again, normal except for tail ends in theoretical quantiles below -1.5 and 1.5
